This repository contains personal work and files, developed and maintained for a successful use with Clover EFI bootloader on this specific Intel NUC model. There are no ready, pre-packaged EFI solutions provided; instead, the needed configuration and ACPI files are published for those interested in studying the code, while creating their own bootloader configurations.
